Creating the Region Area (Collapsable)
 - create a JPanel class with a JPanel as a field and a constructor that takes a JPanel type.
 - apply BorderLayout (NORTH, SOUTH, EAST, WEST, CENTER) to the JPanel class.
 - Add a JPanel to the NORTH with a toggle button and have an icon on toggle button
 - Add the JPanel from constructor to the SOUTH that is the actual region content
 - If Toggle is OFF, then (+) picture is placed on icon and SOUTH region is not Visible
 - If Toggle is ON, then (-) picture is place on icon and SOUTH region is Visible

 
Use the Show Person Form CheckBox example from Swing App to work out how to make JPanel Visible and not Visible, but change the Checkbox to a Toggle Button
